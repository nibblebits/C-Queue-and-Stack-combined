# C-Queue-and-Stack-combined
A simple C queue and stack implentation combined for anyone who needs it

I had trouble finding a queue and a stack combined so I wrote one.

It may have bugs not really fully tested, feel free to do a pull request if its not up to date.

By looking at the code it may be possible for the rear to loop back around and overwrite the front. Its mainly just a skeleton for anyone who needs a quick solution that they can patch a little for their needs.
